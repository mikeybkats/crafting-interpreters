 * ## reallocate
 * ### used for all dynamic memory allocation in clox
 *
 * "allocating memory, freeing it, and changing the size of an existing
 * allocation. Routing all of those operations through a single function will be
 * important later when we add a garbage collector that needs to keep track of
 * how much memory is in use."
 *
 * ### reallocate handles allocations like this:
 *
 * | oldSize	| newSize               |      Operation                |
 * | ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 * | 0	        | Non窶想ero	            | Allocate new block.           |
 * | Non窶想ero	| 0	                    | Free allocation               |
 * | Non窶想ero	| Smaller than oldSize	| Shrink existing allocation    |
 * | Non窶想ero	| Larger than oldSize	| Grow existing allocation.     |
