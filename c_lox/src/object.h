From the C standard:

### ยง 6.7.2.1 13

Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the units in which bit-fields reside have addresses that
increase in the order in which they are declared. A pointer to a structure object, suitably converted, points to its
initial member (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa. There may be
unnamed padding within a structure object, but not at its beginning.
