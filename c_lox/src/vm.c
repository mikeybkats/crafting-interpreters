# VM

"This module is eventually going to have a slew of functions and it would be a
chore to pass around a pointer to the VM to all of them. Instead, we declare a
single global VM object. We need only one anyway, and this keeps the code in the
book a little lighter on the page."

"the choice to have a static VM instance is a concession for the book."

"not necessarily a sound engineering choice for a real language implementation"

"It gives better flexability (if explicitly passing a pointer to the VM) for a
VM that's designed to be embedded in other host applications"

"the host app can control when and where memory for the VM is allocated, run
multiple VMs in parallel, ect"

This is a global variable, and as such comes with all the bad things associated
with global variables.

 "When the interpreter executes a userâ€™s program, it will spend something like
 90% of its time inside run(). It is the beating heart of the VM."

 Visitor pattern for walking the AST."
