# Crafting Interpreters in Rust

Learning Rust by way of Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreter's.

So far this repo just covers the first half of the book - the JLox (Java Lox) interpreter. 

## running the REPL:

`cargo run`

## Running the REPL in multiline mode:

`cargo run -- --multiline`

Typing the word `RUN` followed by `Enter` will submit the code.
